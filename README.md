Currently, a CLI is being primarily used for user interaction. However, we have a working prototype GUI.

## Setup instructions:

Running with CLI (allows the interface to be cleared with each interaction, only supported on Windows for now):

1. Run "py eternity.py" in the COMP354-Team-E folder

<br/><br/>
The recommended IDE is PyCharm as it enables the user to set the root source file directory.

1. Open PyCharm
1. Click Open in the "Welcome to Pycharm" window or click "File"->"Open"
1. Navigate and select the "COMP354-Team-E" folder that was created in step 1
1. Click Ok
1. Right click the COMP354-Team-E folder in the PyCharm project explorer, "Mark Directory As"->"Sources Root"
1. Right click the Functions folder (under the COMP354-Team-E folder) in the PyCharm project explorer, "Mark Directory As"->"Sources Root"
1. Click "Run"->"Run...", setup your Python configuration, and choose the calculator.py to run the project
