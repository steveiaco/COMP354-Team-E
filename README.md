Currently, a CLI is being primarily used for user interaction. However, we have a working prototype GUI.

## Setup instructions:
<br/><br/>
The recommended IDE is PyCharm as it enables the user to set the root source file directory.

1. Clone the repository using `https://github.com/steveiaco/COMP354-Team-E.git`
2. Open PyCharm
3. Click Open in the "Welcome to Pycharm" window or click "File"->"Open"
4. Navigate and select the "COMP354-Team-E" folder that was created in step 1
5. Click Ok
6. Right click the COMP354-Team-E folder in the PyCharm project explorer, "Mark Directory As"->"Sources Root"
6. Right click the Functions folder (under the COMP354-Team-E folder) in the PyCharm project explorer, "Mark Directory As"->"Sources Root"
7. Click "Run"->"Run...", setup your Python configuration, and choose the calculator.py to run the project

Running with CLI (allows the interface to be cleared with each interaction):

1. Run "py eternity.py" in the COMP354-Team-E folder
